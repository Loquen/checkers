# Checkers (Draughts)

#### Draughts (British English) or checkers (American English) is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. Draughts developed from [alquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque), a game originating in the Middle East. The name derives from the verb to draw or to move.
