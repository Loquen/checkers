# Checkers (Draughts)

#### Draughts (British English) or checkers (American English) is a group of strategy board games for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and mandatory captures by jumping over opponent pieces. Draughts developed from [alquerque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alquerque), a game originating in the Middle East. The name derives from the verb to draw or to move.

  - White to play first.
  - Pe贸ns move diagonally forward.
  - If there is an opponent diagonally in front of your 
    pe贸n you can capture with a jump if the following diagonal 
    square is free.
  - If your pe贸n gets to the far side of the board it becomes a 
    king (can move backwards).
  - Game is won when one side captures all the opponent's 
    pe贸ns or the other side is unable to move.
